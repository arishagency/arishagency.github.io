Finding a good anime to watch can be daunting. There’s a lot out there and you shouldn’t spend your time on bullshit.

Below is a list of the best ones I’ve watched so far, mostly on hulu.

For those into it, I'm more of a _shoujo_ guy: That means I'm not really into action-packed stories, and I'm more interested in character's development.

I tried to group series into genres, to set the overall mood: if you like one of the list, chances are you'll like the others too.
